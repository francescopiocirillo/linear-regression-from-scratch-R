This project focuses on implementing and comparing various linear regression techniques using R. Developed as part of a graduate-level assignment for the Data Science & Data Analysis course at the University of Salerno, the objective is to identify the best predictive model for a given dataset by minimizing test set error.

> This demonstrates proficiency in R programming, statistical analysis, and reproducible research workflows.

üìÇ This project is part of a series of regression analysis case studies. For another similar project, see [regression-model-comparison-R](https://github.com/francescopiocirillo/regression-model-comparison-R).

## üìå Objective

Given a dataset with 60 observations and 30 predictors (X1‚ÄìX30), the goal is to:

1. Assess correlation and multicollinearity among predictors.
2. Implement OLS manually, without using `lm()` or `summary()`.
3. Compare manual results with built-in R functions.
4. Apply model selection strategies (stepwise, Ridge, Lasso) to minimize test MSE.
5. Identify statistically significant predictors.

## üåç Language Note

All code comments and the report are written in Italian, as this project was originally developed in an academic setting in Italy. Nonetheless, the structure, organization, and methodology follow international best practices in data science and statistical modeling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Implemented

- üìâ **Correlation analysis** and **multicollinearity check** using `VIF`
- üßÆ **Manual OLS implementation** (matrix algebra, p-values without `summary()`)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Model selection techniques**:
  - Forward selection (Cp, BIC, CV)
  - Backward elimination (Cp, BIC, CV)
  - Hybrid selection
  - Ridge regression
  - Lasso regression
- üß™ **5-fold Cross-validation**
- üìä **MSE computation on test set** to compare all models

## üìà Methodology

- Data split: 80% training / 20% testing
- Models fitted on training set, evaluated on test set
- All MSE values collected and best model selected
- Final model‚Äôs predictors and coefficients reported
